#Function: Given a BED file of coordinates and a file in Refseq format - annotate which genomic regions are overlapped by each coordinate pair. #Input: 1. BED file #		2. RefSeq file (also good for ensGene.txt.gz found in UCSC db)#		Format example: #		3. opts - for intersectBeduse strict; (my $bedFile, my $refseqFile, my $trackDir) = @ARGV; ### create multiple BED files from the gene fileunless (-e ){	my $geneFile = ; 	my $cdsFile = 	my $intronFile = "introns"; 	open (REFSEQ, $geneFile) || die "open $geneFile\n"; 	open (GENES, $) || die "open $geneFile\n"; 	open (CDS, $) || die "open $\n"; 	open (INTRON, $) || die "open $\n"; 	open (SPLICE, $) || die "open $\n"; 	open (FIVE, $) || die "open $\n"; 	open (THREE, $) || die "open $\n";	while (my $l = <REFSEQ>){		chomp $l;		my $f = split (/\t/, $l); 			}	close(REFSEQ); 	close(); 	close();	close(); }### #Multi intersect bed
